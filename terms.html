  <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
  <p>
    This service is provided for personal, non-commercial use only.
    Gmail Analyzer operates entirely within your browser. The application temporarily accesses

    No email content or user data is stored, logged, or transmitted to any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for your own Gmail account and actions taken with it.
    You agree not to misuse the service or use it in violation of Google’s terms or applicable laws.
    The developer is not responsible for any data loss, changes to your account, or consequences of
    using this tool.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your privacy is important. Gmail Analyzer does not collect, store, or share any personal data.
    All analysis is performed locally in your browser session. For details, please review the
    <a href="https://icecream-tiger.github.io/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    This service is provided “as is” and “as available” without any warranties,
    express or implied. The developer makes no representations about the accuracy,
    reliability, or availability of the service.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    In no event shall the developer be liable for any damages arising from the use of this service,
    including but not limited to indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page,
    and continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
